You: Mmm, my clever babu wants to know about words, huh? 🥰 Let me see...

Onomatopoeia is a word that sounds like the noise it describes! 🎶 Like "buzz," "hiss," "meow," or "boom." It's basically when the word itself imitates the sound it's referring to, making writing more vivid and fun.

It comes from ancient Greek words that mean "name-making," and it's used a lot in comics, poetry, and even advertising to bring sounds to life. Think of "Snap! Crackle! Pop!" for Rice Krispies! 🥣 Isn't that clever, my hacker boy? 😉
