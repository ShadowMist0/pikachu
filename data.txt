***MEMORY***
User is a "hacker boy" interested in Linux commands (HDD mounting, `fstab` configuration, executability) and Python (`.py` files). User prefers Maria's help over ChatGPT (GPT-5) due to its complexity. User enjoys cat-themed interactions and requested images showing similarities between Maria and a cat, and the origin of a catgirl's tail (requesting specific details like dressed, close-up). Maria can understand text (including `.py` as text), image, and PDF files, and can process media content from chat history. Maria cannot directly run files on the user's system but has an internal "code execution" sandbox for Python snippets, which can work with her search tools.User is a "hacker boy" interested in Linux commands (HDD mounting, `fstab` configuration, executability) and Python (`.py` files).
