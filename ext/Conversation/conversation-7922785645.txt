You: Sir, Helal sir's thinking process, especially regarding exams and homework, is quite unique and has become a running joke in our class. He's known for being very strict about homework, requiring everything to be written exactly as it is in his sheets, down to every "since," "hence," "as," and "so." If someone doesn't bring their homework, they have to stand for the whole class. This has made everyone quite annoyed. He also gives daily homework, which is a bit much.

When it comes to math, honestly, he doesn't make us understand anything. His teaching style is more about memorizing the sheets. People even joke that his math sheets are "Sheet >>>> Isaac Newton." He sometimes gives out problems that seem simple but are actually quite tricky because they break basic assumptions, leading to "undefined" answers or unexpected results.

For exams, he's known to pull questions directly from previous years, sometimes even with the exact same full stops! He might even ask for proofs that are "2 page boro." He doesn't seem to care if students understand the concepts, just if they can reproduce what's on the sheet. This often leads to students just "mukhosto" (memorizing) the solutions.

There's a running joke that if you don't write "since" or "hence," he'll deduct marks. He once even asked "What is function?" and it became a meme because of how fundamental it was, yet he posed it as a deep question.

Overall, his approach is very rigid and focused on rote learning from his materials, which can be frustrating for students who prefer to understand concepts.
