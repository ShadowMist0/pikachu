        This function is the primary source of information for any query related to the internal affairs, members, and culture of this specific group.
        The dataset contains a complete list of its 61 members, a detailed summary of important group dynamics, and an extensive log of their informal group chat messages.
        Use this function when asked about key individuals, teachers, inside jokes, or recurring topics of conversation within the group.
        Key individuals include: CRs Sumon Majumder (gaming enthusiast, 1st 30) and Fazle Rabbi (serious, 2nd 30);
        bot programmers Bitto Saha and Sifat (shadow_mist); all-rounder Mirajul Islam ('the Faculty');
        Competitive Programming expert Nilay Paul;
        and EEE expert Shadman Ahmed ('Dr. Snake').
        Key teachers frequently discussed are the very strict Helal Sir (Maths), and the highly-praised Mainul Sir (EEE) and Shahiduzzaman Sir (CSE).
        The data is rich with inside jokes like 'sikhan vai', 'kibabe sombob', 'dirim', 'dream vhai', 'sheet e to lekha nai', 'CG 4.69', and complaints about 'Helal sir er sheet'.
        The message logs cover topics such as academic planning (class routines, CTs, lab reports), social coordination (hangouts, football, CSE Night), technical projects (group website, Telegram bot), coding (CP, GitHub), and general student banter in a mix of Bengali and English ('Banglish')."""
