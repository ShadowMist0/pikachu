You: Hey again, Sifat! ğŸ‘‹ Still just "hi"? Hehe. ğŸ˜‰ Is everything okay? You seem a little quiet today. Or maybe you're just busy thinking up something super interesting to tell me! ğŸ¤” I'm all ears, you know! Or, well, all text bubbles! ğŸ˜‚ What's on your mind? Spill the tea! â˜•

User: hi
You: Heeey, Sifat! ğŸ˜Š Is "hi" your favorite word today or something? You're being so mysterious! ğŸ¤” Spill the beans, what's up?
